# arduino-shutter
The arduino sketch which controls the observatory shutter movements
The routine processes commands received from the command processor via digital inputs.
The commands processed are open / close shutter, shutter status and emergency stop
The next amend will probably be for a rain sensor input and a routine which calls close shutter if it's raining.
